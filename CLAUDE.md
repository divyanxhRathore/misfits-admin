## Venue Management System - Venue Admin App Context

### Project Overview
This Flutter application is the **Venue Admin App** for venue managers in the Misfits Venue Management System (VMS). The VMS aims to replace WhatsApp-based venue management with a structured platform that connects club leaders with venues.

### App Purpose
The Venue Admin App enables venue managers to:
- Centralize management of all events and bookings
- Receive and respond to association requests from Misfits club leaders
- Manage venue details, calendars, and partnerships efficiently

### Core Features

#### 1. Venue Setup and Configuration
- **Amenities Management**: Detail available amenities (sound systems, projectors, seating, catering, Wi-Fi, accessibility)
- **Interactive Map Integration**: Location details, landmarks, and directions
- **Image Gallery**: Upload images and virtual tours of spaces
- **Terms of Association**: Define pricing, cancellation policies, operational hours, event rules, cover charges

#### 2. Association Request Management Dashboard
- **Centralized Request Viewing**: View incoming requests with:
  - Requesting club details
  - Proposed event type
  - Desired dates
  - Estimated attendance (footfall)
  - Equipment requirements
  - Fee collection preferences
- **Approval/Rejection Workflow**: Approve, reject, or modify terms for requests
- **Request Status**: In-process, Complete, or Rejected

#### 3. Calendar Management
- **Integrated Event Scheduling**: Manage Misfits events and external events in unified view
- **Automatic Event Integration**: Approved events auto-added to calendar
- **Blackout Dates**: Mark unavailable dates
- **Conflict Prevention**: Optimize venue utilization

### Operational Framework

#### Account Management
- Individual secure accounts for each venue manager
- Multi-venue support with seamless switching between venues
- Guided initial setup flow â†’ Dashboard redirection

#### Partnership Workflow
1. **Request Reception**: Receive requests (leaders limited to 2 venue queries)
2. **Review & Response**: Accept/Reject/Modify terms
3. **Mutual Acceptance**: Both parties must approve final terms
4. **Discrepancy Handling**: Leaders can raise issues, venues revise terms

#### Meeting Coordination
- Request meetings through operations team
- Operations team facilitates scheduling between venue manager and club leader

### Key Business Rules
- Club leaders can query maximum 2 venues
- Mutual acceptance required for partnerships
- Transparent terms definition
- Auto-calendar integration upon approval

### Data Requirements from Club Leaders
- Estimated footfall per meetup
- Equipment requirements
- Fee collection preferences (upfront payment details)
- Activity type

### Development Focus Areas
1. **Initial Setup Flow**: Complete venue profile configuration
2. **Dashboard**: Primary interface for request management
3. **Request Management**: Quick approve/reject/modify workflow
4. **Calendar Integration**: Seamless event scheduling
5. **Terms Management**: Clear definition and modification tools

### Integration Points
- Club leader frontend system connection
- Operations team communication
- Automatic calendar synchronization
- Real-time status updates
